# translate-british-english
Input a string or HTML which uses British English spelling (and Metric units) => output American English spelling (and imperial units)

# configureable options:
unit-conversions
characters to ignore near unit conversions
debug option on function (prints all translations to console)

would be very simple to translate the other way.
